# Booking component

I know I went a bit overboard, but that's me.
It took me roughly 6 to 7 hours to complete this.
Anyhow, here are some notes:

* I used https://www.air-port-codes.com/ api for airport 
  autocomplete. Not a good one for production but does the job.
* The api won't respond to more than 3 character keywords, so
bear that in mind when using the SearchAirport component
  
Thanks!
